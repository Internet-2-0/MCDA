This stops attackers from dynamically running applications, trying to understand how they work and changing the behavior of certain features or checks within the application. Malicious applications use anti-debugging to prevent reverse engineers from dynamically analyzing the code and can potentially be an indication of malware.","title":"Anti-Debugging Imports"}},{"discovered":["GetModuleHandle","GetStartupInfo","ShellExecute","System","GetCurrentProcess","GetCurrentThreadId","GetTickCount","SetUnhandledExceptionFilter","UnhandledExceptionFilter"],"info":{"description":"The file statically imports commonly known malicious Windows API endpoints, or imports Windows libraries that have been used by multiple malware samples over time.
